# Sinatra Fwitter 5 -  Sessions

## Outline
1. Explain the difference between authentication and authorization. The most basic form of authentication is simply asking for a username.
2. Enable sessions and set a session secret in the application controller.
3. Create a template called `login.erb` with a form asking for a username. 
4. Update the application controller - upon submission of the form, find the user by username and set the session[:user_id] to that user's id. If no user is found, redirect to signup.
5. Update the new tweet form so that the user is set by the current user in the session id, instead of asking for a user's username. 
6. Create a `/logout` route that destroys the session. 
7. Add logic so that the new tweet form is only displayed to logged_in users.
8. Add helper methods: `current_user` to return the user based on session[:id] and `logged_in?` to return true or false based on the presence of a session[:user_id]

## Objectives

1. Understand the difference between authentication and authorization
2. Implement sessions into our Sinatra applications
3. Use session data to change content based on whether or not a user is logged in.

## Overview

Two of the most important aspects of social media applications are authentication and authorization. In a nutshell, authentication means having a user identify themselves in your application, while authorization determines what privelages a user has. For example, anyone can view other people's Tweets on Twitter, but only logged in users can post new content. 

Today, we'll be updating our Fwitter application so that only logged in users can post content, and new tweets will automatically be associated with the logged in user.
